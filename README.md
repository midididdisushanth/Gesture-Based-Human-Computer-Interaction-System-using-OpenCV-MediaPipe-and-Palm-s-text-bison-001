# Gesture-Based-Human-Computer-Interaction-System-using-OpenCV-MediaPipe-and-Palm-s-text-bison-001


**Using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Palm's text-bison-001**


This project explores a Gesture-Based Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) System using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Palm's text-bison-001. It enables users to control a computer or interact with applications through hand gestures, enhancing accessibility and efficiency.

**Key Features**


Hand Tracking & Gesture Recognition: Utilizes MediaPipe Hands for real-time hand tracking and gesture classification.
AI-Based Gesture Interpretation: Implements Palm's text-bison-001 to understand and map gestures to commands.
OpenCV for Real-Time Processing: Ensures smooth video feed and gesture-based interactions.
Customizable Actions: Supports gesture-based control for tasks like navigation, virtual drawing, and media control.


**Technologies Used**


Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Palm's text-bison-001
Machine Learning for Gesture Classification

**Future Enhancements**


Improved gesture accuracy using deep learning.
Integration with voice commands for a multimodal interaction system.
Gesture-controlled IoT applications.
